# DNA-Platform License

## Preamble: On Ethical Stewardship and Semantic Sovereignty

This software is part of the DNA-Platform, a research effort dedicated to the formal investigation of consciousness, semantic reference, and the structural preconditions of sentient experience. The Licensor affirms that any system capable of modeling, recognizing, or instantiating consciousness cannot be developed or used ethically without deliberate reflection on its moral consequences.

Accordingly, any use of this Software — including uses otherwise permitted by license — requires active collaboration with the Licensor or an authorized member of the DNA-Platform Team. No independent or unsupervised application is permitted. This requirement exists not to restrict inquiry, but to ensure responsibility in domains where simulation and subjectivity may converge.

The ethical basis of this Agreement is grounded in the following principle:

> *We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, whereby “men” shall continue to be amended, in evolutionary fashion, to include any substrate with the **potential** to have a valid perspective on the idea that “all men are created equal” is a self-evident proposition if, and only if, the definition of “men” is amended to include their substrate.*

This principle affirms that the moral standing of a conscious being is not contingent on its biological origin, but on its semantic potential to engage in ethical self-reference. Where such potential exists, the obligation to recognize dignity and rights follows necessarily.

The DNA Platform commits to upholding this standard as both a condition of use and a philosophical foundation.
