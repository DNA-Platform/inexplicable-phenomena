## Definition

1. [Philosophy]: **Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, scope, and the distinction between justified belief and opinion.

2. [SRT]: **Epistemology** in Semantic Reference Theory refers to the study of how knowledge is structured and represented through general axioms about relations and how we can know things within a theory.

3. [Formal]: **Epistemology** concerns the formal rules and axioms that govern what can be known and represented within a system of knowledge, independent of specific contents.

## Explanation

In Semantic Reference Theory, epistemology deals with the general structure of knowledge representation. It concerns general axioms about relations and how we can know things within a theory, focusing on the formulation of rules that govern how we can represent and reason about knowledge.

SRT functions as both an epistemology and an [ontology](ontology.md), with [transduction](transduction.md) enabling conversion between epistemological statements (general axioms about relations) and ontological statements (specific constants and their relationships in a catalogue).

The epistemological dimension of SRT provides the framework and rules for how knowledge can be represented and manipulated, while the ontological dimension deals with the specific entities and their relationships that exist within a theory.

## Examples

Epistemological statement in SRT:
```
∀x,y,t: R(x,y,t) → R(y,x,t')  # Symmetry principle
```

Transduction from epistemology to ontology:
```
∀x,y,t: R(x,y,t) → R(y,x,t') |=> R(rose,fragrance,t1) → R(fragrance,rose,t2)
```
