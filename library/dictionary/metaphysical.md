## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Metaphysical** refers to that which relates to "the transcendent or to a reality beyond what is perceptible to the senses" (Merriam-Webster).

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, **metaphysical** describes phenomena that transcend physical explanation while still relating to physical processes, occupying a domain that bridges physical reality and representational frameworks.

3. [Philosophical]: **Metaphysical** refers to that which exists beyond or transcends the physical or material world, concerning the fundamental nature of reality, existence, and being.

## Explanation

The metaphysical nature of consciousness is a key insight in understanding the Hard Problem. Consciousness precisely fits the definition of metaphysical: it transcends physical explanation while still relating to physical processes. It exists in a unique relationship to physical reality.

In the SRT framework, metaphysical phenomena emerge through the process of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md), where physical phenomena are transformed into representations within a [perspective](perspective.md). These representations constitute a different ontological category while preserving structural relationships to their physical origins.

The relationship between metaphysical and physical can be understood through the transduction operator (|=>), which carries physical stimuli across the representational divide:

```
[Physical Phenomena] |=> [Metaphysical Phenomena within a Perspective]
```

This operation preserves certain structural relationships between the physical stimuli while transforming them into a fundamentally different ontological category. The resulting metaphysical phenomena form the contents of consciousness and establish the semantic surface of our experience.

Chalmers captures this distinction when stating "Experience may arise from the physical, but it is not entailed by the physical." This positions consciousness in a unique metaphysical relationship to physical reality - arising from it but not reducible to it.

## Examples

Visual perception:
```
[Photons reflecting off a rose] |=> [Conscious experience of redness]
```

Auditory perception:
```
[Pressure waves in air] |=> [Conscious experience of music]
```

Complex perception:
```
[Multiple sensory inputs from environment] |=> [Unified conscious experience of "being in a garden"]
```

Absence of perception under anesthesia:
```
[Visual inputs still activate visual cortex] â‰ > [No conscious experience occurs]
```
