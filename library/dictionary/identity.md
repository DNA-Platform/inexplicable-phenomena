## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Identity** is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is; the characteristics determining this.

2. [Semantic]: **Identity** is the intrinsic quality that enables a referent to be itself and to be distinguishable from other referents. It is established through the process of [identification](identification.md) within a [perspective](perspective.md).

3. [Formal]: `(o) =(o)> o`

## Explanation

The formal expression `(o) =(o)> o` represents self-reference, which is the essence of identity in SRT. This formula means that the canonical symbol of an object serves as a symbol for the object itself.

Identity is foundational in SRT - before a referent can have qualities or participate in relationships, it must first have identity. This makes identity ontologically prior to other aspects of reference.

Within a perspective, identity is not inherent in objects themselves but is attributed through the process of [identification](identification.md), expressed as:

`(i) =(o)> (o) |=identify> (o) =(o)> o`

This shows how a perspective's qualifier `(i)` identifies an object, enabling it to possess its own identity intrinsically.

A key insight of SRT is that identity is always relative to a perspective. The statement `(i) =(i)> i` expresses that the qualifier of a perspective has the intrinsic quality of identity itself - it possesses a "self" that allows it to qualify other referents.

## Examples

Self-identity:
```
rose =(rose)> rose
```
This expresses that the rose has its own identity.

Perspective-based identity:
```
(i) =(rose)> (rose)
```
This expresses that the perspective attributes identity to a rose.
