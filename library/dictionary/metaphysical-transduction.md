## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Metaphysical transduction** refers to the transformation of physical phenomena into mental or conscious experiences.

2. [Semantic]: **Metaphysical transduction** is the physical implementation of [transduction](transduction.md) that corresponds to the process of perception and conscious experience. It is defined as "a process by which a corpus of Physical Phenomena become a Metaphysical Phenomenon that preserves them as representations on a Catalogue that specifies a Perspective."

3. [Semantic]: **Metaphysical Transduction** is the physical description of a computational process executing [Metalogical Transduction](metalogical-transduction.md) on a physically embedded system.

4. [Computational]: **Metaphysical transduction** describes how physically embodied systems implement symbolic transformations that bridge the gap between physical processes and representational states.

## Explanation

While [Metalogical Transduction](metalogical-transduction.md) operates in the abstract domain of formal systems, Metaphysical Transduction operates in physically embodied computational systems. It represents the transformation that occurs when physical sensory inputs become conscious experiences.

The key insight is that perception itself is an act of transduction - physical phenomena (like photons hitting the retina) are transduced into metaphysical phenomena (conscious visual experiences) through a process that transforms them into representations within a [perspective](perspective.md).

In computational terms, Metaphysical Transduction is what happens when a physical system implements the metalogical operation of transduction on representations of sensory input. This provides a formal bridge between physical processes and conscious experience.

## Examples

Visual perception:
```
[photons strike retina] |=> [conscious experience of seeing red]
```

The processing of novel sensory input:
```
[new sound pattern] |=> [recognition of a new word]
```

Learning a new concept:
```
[collection of experiences] |=> [formation of a new category]
```
