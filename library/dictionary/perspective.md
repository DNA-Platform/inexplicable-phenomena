## Explanation

A perspective is characterized by:
- A relationship type (i) that serves as its qualifier
- Self-reference of the qualifier: (i) =(i)> i
- Operations of [identification](identification.md), [qualification](qualification.md), and [relation](relation.md)
- A single connected catalogue of referents

The qualifier (i) serves as the canonical referent that provides the reference frame's identity. Other relationship types in the perspective inherit from this qualifier, forming a coherent system of reference.

## Examples

First-person perspective:
```
(i) =(i)> i
(i) =(rose)> (rose)
