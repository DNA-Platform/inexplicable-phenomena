## Definition

1. [Scientific]: **Physical phenomena** are events, objects, and processes occurring in the physical world that can be observed, measured, and described using the methods and concepts of natural science.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, **physical phenomena** are those aspects of reality that exist prior to and independent of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md), serving as inputs to the transduction process that produces [conscious experiences](conscious-experience.md).

3. [Ontological]: **Physical phenomena** constitute the domain of objectively existing entities that form the foundation for scientific inquiry and that stand in contrast to the metaphysical phenomena they give rise to through the process of perception.

## Explanation

Physical phenomena form one side of the fundamental division at the heart of SRT and consciousness studies. They exist in physical reality and are the subject of scientific inquiry, characterized by their objective measurability, causal interactions, and independence from any particular observer.

In the framework presented in "On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena," physical phenomena include photons of light, pressure waves of sound, neural activity, and all other physical processes that can be measured by instruments and described in the language of physics, chemistry, and biology.

The relationship between physical phenomena and [metaphysical phenomena](metaphysical.md) is captured by the transduction operator (|=>), which represents the transformation that occurs when physical stimuli are carried across the representational divide:

```
[Physical Phenomena] |=> [Metaphysical Phenomena within a Perspective]
```

This operation preserves certain structural relationships between the physical stimuli while transforming them into a fundamentally different ontological category. The physical phenomena serve as the input to this transformation, while the resulting metaphysical phenomena form the contents of consciousness.

An important characteristic of physical phenomena is that they can be present and measurable even when no conscious experience occurs. For example, under general anesthesia, visual inputs still activate the primary visual cortex, but no conscious perception takes place. This illustrates that physical phenomena alone are not sufficient for consciousness - metaphysical transduction must occur.

## Examples

Sensory stimuli:
```
- Photons reflecting off objects
- Pressure waves traveling through air
- Chemical molecules binding to receptors
- Temperature variations activating thermoreceptors
```

Neural processing:
```
- Action potentials in sensory neurons
- Neurotransmitter release at synapses
- Activation patterns in primary sensory cortices
- Neural synchronization across brain regions
```

Complete transformation chains:
```
[Photons at 700nm wavelength] |=> [Experience of redness]
[Pressure waves at 440Hz] |=> [Experience of A note]
[Neural activity in pain pathways] |=> [Experience of pain]
```

Absence of transduction under anesthesia:
```
[Visual inputs activate visual cortex] â‰ > [No conscious experience occurs]
```
