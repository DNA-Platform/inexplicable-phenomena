## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: A **canonical** is a specified referent in a catalogue that serves as an identity for the catalogue.

2. [Semantic]: A **canonical** is a specified referent in a catalogue that serves as an identity for the catalogue.

3. [Formal]: The **canonical** value of `x` in the subject of t is denoted:`t[x]*`

## Explanation

In [Semantic Reference Theory](./semantic-reference-theory.md), canonicals establish the foundational [identity](./identity.md) for [catalogues](./catalogue.md) of [referents](./referent.md). They serve as the anchoring points through which all other referents in the catalogue derive their meaning within the system. The canonical value of a referent `x` with respect to a relationship type `t` can be formally expressed as `t[x]*`.
