## Definition

1. [Semantic]: **Metaphysical phenomena** are the representations of [physical phenomena](physical-phenomena.md) that emerge through the process of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md) and constitute the content of [conscious experiences](conscious-experience.md) within a [perspective](perspective.md).

2. [Phenomenological]: **Metaphysical phenomena** are the direct, first-person experiential qualities that present themselves to consciousness, including sensations, thoughts, emotions, and all other contents of subjective experience.

3. [Formal]: **Metaphysical phenomena** are the output of the transduction operation that transforms physical processes into representations within a perspective, preserving structural relationships while changing ontological category.

## Explanation

Metaphysical phenomena form the essential content of consciousness. They are what we experience directly when we see colors, hear sounds, feel emotions, have thoughts, or experience any other aspect of conscious life. Unlike physical phenomena, which exist in the objective world and can be measured with instruments, metaphysical phenomena exist only within perspectives and are directly accessible only to the subjects that experience them.

The relationship between physical and metaphysical phenomena is captured by the transduction operator (|=>), which represents the transformation that occurs when physical stimuli are carried across the representational divide:

```
[Physical Phenomena] |=> [Metaphysical Phenomena within a Perspective]
```

This operation preserves certain structural relationships between the physical stimuli while transforming them into a fundamentally different ontological category. The resulting metaphysical phenomena form the contents of consciousness and establish the semantic surface of our experience.

Metaphysical phenomena have several distinctive characteristics:
1. They are [self-evident](self-evident.md) to the subject experiencing them
2. They are [inexplicable](inexplicable.md) in purely physical terms
3. They exist only within a perspective, not in objective physical reality
4. They preserve structural relationships to the physical phenomena that give rise to them
5. They serve as the representational medium through which we understand the world

The title of "On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena" refers directly to these aspects - metaphysical phenomena are formally inexplicable yet self-evident. This paradoxical nature is at the heart of the Hard Problem of consciousness.

## Examples

Sensory experiences:
```
- The visual experience of redness
- The auditory experience of a musical note
- The tactile sensation of smoothness
- The taste of sweetness
```

Mental phenomena:
```
- Thoughts and concepts
- Emotional states
- Mental imagery
- Memory experiences
```

Complex experiential states:
```
- The unified experience of "being in a garden"
- The aesthetic appreciation of a work of art
- The sense of self-awareness
- The experience of making a decision
```

Transduction relationships:
```
[Photons at 700nm wavelength] |=> [Experience of redness]
[Complex neural patterns in auditory cortex] |=> [Experience of a symphony]
[Integration of multiple sensory inputs] |=> [Unified conscious scene]
```
