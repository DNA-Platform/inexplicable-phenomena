## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: A **phenomenon** is both "an object or aspect known through the senses" and "a fact or event of scientific interest susceptible to scientific description and explanation."

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, a **phenomenon** is that which presents itself within a [perspective](perspective.md), whether as a direct representation of physical reality (physical phenomenon) or as a representation within consciousness (metaphysical phenomenon).

3. [Kantian]: A **phenomenon** is an object as it appears to an observer, as distinguished from a noumenon (the thing-in-itself) which exists independent of perception.

## Explanation

The term "phenomenon" captures the dual nature of conscious experience perfectly. It is simultaneously the subjective experience itself and the object of our scientific inquiry. The etymological connection between "phenomenon" and "phenomenal" reinforces this as the appropriate term for describing both physical events and conscious experiences.

In SRT, phenomena exist in two distinct but related categories:

1. **Physical Phenomena**: Events, objects, and processes that exist in physical reality and can be directly measured, observed, and described using scientific methods. These include photons, sound waves, neural activity, and other objective physical processes.

2. **Metaphysical Phenomena**: The representations of physical phenomena that emerge through the process of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md) and exist within a conscious [perspective](perspective.md). These include our subjective experiences of color, sound, taste, and other qualia.

The relationship between these two types of phenomena is captured by the transduction operator (|=>):

```
[Physical Phenomena] |=> [Metaphysical Phenomena]
```

This transduction preserves certain structural relationships while transforming the ontological category of the phenomena. The resulting metaphysical phenomena form the contents of consciousness.

Phenomena are essential to both science and consciousness studies. Science begins with the observation of phenomena and seeks to explain them through theory. Similarly, consciousness begins with phenomena presented directly to experience, which become the foundation for a perspective.

## Examples

Physical phenomena:
```
- Photons reflecting off objects
- Sound waves moving through air
- Neurons firing in patterns
- Chemical reactions in sensory receptors
```

Metaphysical phenomena:
```
- The experience of seeing red
- The sensation of hearing music
- The feeling of warmth
- The taste of sweetness
```

Transduction relationships:
```
[Photons at 700nm wavelength] |=> [Experience of redness]
[Pressure waves at 440Hz] |=> [Experience of A note]
[C6H12O6 molecules binding to taste receptors] |=> [Experience of sweetness]
```
