## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Self** refers to the person, thing, or quality that is identical with or possesses an individual's essential being.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, a **self** is a unique possession of the subject of a [conscious experience](conscious-experience.md), inseparable from the [identity](identity.md) that possesses it.

3. [Philosophical]: **Self** denotes the conscious, reflexive center of a perspective that distinguishes the subject from all other entities and provides a first-person frame of reference.

## Explanation

The concept of self is fundamental to understanding consciousness and perspective. As articulated in "On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena," the self is revealed through linguistic expressions like "I do not feel like my*self* today" or "I must see it for my*self*." These expressions disclose that the self is something possessed by an identity that serves as the subject of conscious experiences.

In SRT, the relationship between identity and self is intimate yet distinct. The identity is the subject, while the self is its object. This distinction allows for the first-person perspective that characterizes consciousness. When we say "I feel like my*self* again," we're acknowledging this subject-object relationship within our own being.

The self serves several essential functions in conscious experience:

1. It provides the center of a [perspective](perspective.md) from which all experiences are organized
2. It enables self-evidence by establishing a subject for whom phenomena can be directly apparent
3. It creates the possibility of self-reference, which is necessary for reflexive awareness
4. It distinguishes one consciousness from another, establishing uniqueness of experience

The self is not a static entity but emerges from the dynamic process of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md) as perspectives evolve. It represents the sense of continuity that persists through changes in conscious experience.

## Examples

First-person perspective statements:
```
"I think, therefore I am" - Descartes identifying the self as the irreducible subject of thought
```

Self-evidence in perception:
```
[Subject] sees [red rose] for [self] â†’ direct, unmediated experience
```

Self as object of reflection:
```
"I don't feel like my[self]" - The identity (I) possessing but temporarily disconnected from its self
```

Self-reference in consciousness:
```
[Perspective] =(self_reference)> [Perspective] - A perspective that includes awareness of itself
```
