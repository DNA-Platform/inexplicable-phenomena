## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: In grammar, a **subject** is the person or thing that performs the action expressed by a verb or about which something is stated.

2. [Semantic]: A **subject** is a [referent](referent.md) that participates in a direct [relationship](relationship.md) with a distinct [object](object.md). In the [ternary relation](ternary.md) R(x,y,t), x is the subject when x â‰  y.

3. [Formal]: `E[x,y,t]: x =t> y =|> x != y =|> E[S]: x.S`

## Explanation

The formal expression states that for any referents x and y related through t, if x and y are distinct, then there exists a property S such that x has this property. This property S represents the quality of "being a subject."

A key insight in SRT is that subjectivity requires reference to something distinct from oneself. A referent is not considered a subject when it relates only to itself (as in a [property](property.md) relationship). The statement "Doug is Doug" does not establish Doug as a subject, but "Doug sees the rose" does.

This connects to the philosophical notion that subjectivity emerges through the act of reference - of directing attention outward toward objects separate from oneself.

## Examples

Simple subject-object relationship:
```
Doug =sees> rose
```
Here, "Doug" is the subject who sees the rose.

Subject in multiple relationships:
```
Doug =reads> book
Doug =writes> letter
```
"Doug" is the subject in both relationships.

Non-subject case:
```
rose =red> rose
```
Here, rose is relating to itself, so it is not functioning as a subject in the SRT sense.

  - How does the formal property S (subjecthood) relate to the philosophical concept of subjectivity?
  - What is the relationship between being a subject and having a [perspective](perspective.md)?
  - Can a referent be both a subject and an object in different relationships?
  - Is there a deeper connection between the subject property (S) and the perspective qualifier (i)?
  - What role does self-reference play in the development of subjective consciousness?
