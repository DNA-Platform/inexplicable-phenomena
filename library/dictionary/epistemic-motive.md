## Definition

1. [SRT]: An **epistemic motive** is a drive or principle that guides a system's knowledge-seeking behavior, particularly what motivates a system to extend itself through [transduction](transduction.md).

2. [Cognitive]: An **epistemic motive** is an underlying reason or purpose that drives knowledge acquisition and cognitive development.

3. [Formal Systems]: An **epistemic motive** is a principle that explains why a formal system would extend beyond its current axiomatization to incorporate new truths.

## Explanation

In SRT, epistemic motives explain why a system would perform transduction operations that extend its ontology. Completeness serves as a key epistemic motive - systems are driven to incorporate novel elements (like Gödel sentences) that transcend their current framework.

When a system encounters a statement that can't be satisfied within its current structure (like a self-referential statement about novelty), the epistemic motive of completeness drives it to extend itself through transduction. This creates a semantic justification for why systems evolve and incorporate new elements.

This concept is particularly illuminating when considering consciousness. Just as formal systems are driven to incorporate unprovable truths (Gödel sentences), conscious systems may be driven to incorporate genuinely novel experiences that transcend their current framework.

## Examples

Completeness as an epistemic motive:
```
G = "G is not provable in system S"
S encounters G and extends to S' that includes G as an axiom
```

Novelty as an epistemic motive:
```
NDPg = "This pattern is new to Doug personally"
Doug encounters NDPg and incorporates it into his perspective
```

### Thoughts
  - What other epistemic motives besides completeness might drive transduction?
  - How do epistemic motives relate to the semantic assertions a system makes about itself?
  - Is there a formal hierarchy or priority system among different epistemic motives?
