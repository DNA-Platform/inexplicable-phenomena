## Entries

### [Ancestry](./dictionary/ancestry.md)
A concept currently under development as part of the expanding SRT framework. It relates to the lineage and inheritance relationships between referents in a catalogue.

### [Canonical](./dictionary/canonical.md)
A specified [referent](./dictionary/referent.md) in a [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md) that serves as an [identity](./dictionary/identity.md) for the catalogue. The canonical value of a referent with respect to a relationship type provides an anchoring point for meaning.

### [Canonical Symbol](./dictionary/canonical-symbol.md)
The standard [symbol](./dictionary/symbol.md) used to refer to a [referent](./dictionary/referent.md). Establishes the most commonly used reference for something within a semantic framework.

### [Catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md)
A collection of connected [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) forming the [domain](./dictionary/domain.md) of a [semantic theory](./dictionary/semantic-theory.md). All referents must be connected through [relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md) either directly or via [inheritance](./dictionary/inheritance.md), with growth occurring through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md).

### [Conscious Experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md)
An [inexplicable](./dictionary/inexplicable.md) yet [self-evident](./dictionary/self-evident.md) [metaphysical phenomenon](./dictionary/metaphysical-phenomena.md) representing a change in [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md). Emerges through [metaphysical transduction](./dictionary/metaphysical-transduction.md) of [physical phenomena](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md).

### [Constant](./dictionary/constant.md)
A specific, fixed [referent](./dictionary/referent.md) within a [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md) that maintains [identity](./dictionary/identity.md) across the [domain](./dictionary/domain.md) of a [semantic theory](./dictionary/semantic-theory.md).

### [Definition](./dictionary/definition.md)
A statement establishing meaning through equivalence to formal expressions using the [transduction operator](./dictionary/transduction.md). All [SRT](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md) definitions anchor ultimately in the primitive [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md).

### [Dictionary](./dictionary/.dictionary.md)
A [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md) of [definitions](./dictionary/definition.md) that serves as a [canonical](./dictionary/canonical.md) source of meaning. This very document recursively defines itself as it contains its own reference.

### [Domain](./dictionary/domain.md)
The collection of all [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) within a [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md), establishing the scope for [semantic theories](./dictionary/semantic-theory.md). Domains can expand through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md) and must maintain connectedness through [relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md).

### [Epistemic Motive](./dictionary/epistemic-motive.md)
The drive that compels systems to extend themselves through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md) when encountering [inexplicable](./dictionary/inexplicable.md) elements. Represents the fundamental tendency toward completeness in [consciousness](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md) and formal systems.

### [Epistemology](./dictionary/epistemology.md)
The study of knowledge and justification, contrasted with [ontology](./dictionary/ontology.md) in [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md). SRT bridges epistemology and ontology through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md) operations.

### [First-Order Logic](./dictionary/first-order-logic.md)
A formal system that [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md) draws inspiration from while replacing traditional symbology with programmatic notation. Extended by SRT's [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md) framework.

### [Formal Logic](./dictionary/formal-logic.md)
A symbolic reasoning system that [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md) builds upon while adopting programmatic grammar. SRT extends formal logic through [ternary relations](./dictionary/ternary.md) and [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md).

### [Hard Problem](./dictionary/hard-problem.md)
The challenge of explaining how [physical phenomena](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md) give rise to [conscious experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md). In SRT, framed as the [inexplicable](./dictionary/inexplicable.md) nature of [metaphysical transduction](./dictionary/metaphysical-transduction.md).

### [Identification](./dictionary/identification.md)
The first fundamental operation of a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md) that assigns [identity](./dictionary/identity.md) to [referents](./dictionary/referent.md), enabling them to possess intrinsic identity. Precedes [qualification](./dictionary/qualification.md) and [relation](./dictionary/relation.md).

### [Identity](./dictionary/identity.md)
The intrinsic quality enabling a [referent](./dictionary/referent.md) to be itself, established through [identification](./dictionary/identification.md) within a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md). Expressed formally as self-reference: `(o) =(o)> o`.

### [Inexplicable](./dictionary/inexplicable.md)
That which cannot be derived from the axioms of a system despite being recognized as real, similar to GÃ¶del sentences. Core to understanding why [conscious experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md) is [metaphysical](./dictionary/metaphysical.md) rather than physical.

### [Inheritance](./dictionary/inheritance.md)
A [transitive](./dictionary/transitivity.md) relationship enabling [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) to connect through chains of [direct relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md). Creates hierarchical structures within [catalogues](./dictionary/catalogue.md) and enables [property](./dictionary/property.md) inheritance.

### [Literal](./dictionary/literal.md)
A [referent](./dictionary/referent.md) that serves as an endpoint in [reference](./dictionary/reference.md) chains, representing concrete [objects](./dictionary/object.md) that are not themselves [symbols](./dictionary/symbol.md) for other entities.

### [Literature](./dictionary/literature.md)
The collection of [objects](./dictionary/object.md) in a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md), complementing [symbolism](./dictionary/symbolism.md) to form complete representational systems. Represents what is symbolized rather than the symbolizing elements.

### [Logic](./dictionary/logic.md)

### [Metaphysical](./dictionary/metaphysical.md)
Relating to phenomena that transcend physical explanation while still relating to physical processes. In SRT, [conscious experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md) is metaphysical because it emerges from but cannot be reduced to [physical phenomena](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md).

### [Metaphysical Phenomena](./dictionary/metaphysical-phenomena.md)
Representations of [physical phenomena](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md) that emerge through [metaphysical transduction](./dictionary/metaphysical-transduction.md) and constitute [conscious experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md).

### [Perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md)
A [semantic reference frame](./dictionary/semantic-reference-frame.md) with a single [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md) that enables [identification](./dictionary/identification.md), [qualification](./dictionary/qualification.md), and [relation](./dictionary/relation.md). Contains a qualifier that provides [self-reference](./dictionary/self.md) and establishes first-person experience.

### [Phenomenon](./dictionary/phenomenon.md)
An observable event or experience that serves as an object of study. In SRT, phenomena are categorized as either [physical](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md) or [metaphysical](./dictionary/metaphysical-phenomena.md) based on their relationship to [consciousness](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md).

### [Physical Phenomena](./dictionary/physical-phenomena.md)
Events and processes in objective reality that serve as inputs to [metaphysical transduction](./dictionary/metaphysical-transduction.md). Include measurable entities like photons and neural activity that exist independently of [consciousness](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md).

### [Property](./dictionary/property.md)
A special case of [relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md) where the [subject](./dictionary/subject.md) and [object](./dictionary/object.md) are identical (R(x,x,t)). Properties represent intrinsic characteristics established through [qualification](./dictionary/qualification.md) within a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md).

### [Qualification](./dictionary/qualification.md)
The second fundamental operation of a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md) that assigns qualities to [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) through [properties](./dictionary/property.md). Follows [identification](./dictionary/identification.md) and precedes [relation](./dictionary/relation.md).

### [Reference](./dictionary/reference.md)
The directional act by which a [subject](./dictionary/subject.md) relates to a distinct [object](./dictionary/object.md) through specific [relationship types](./dictionary/relationship.md). Reference mediates meaning through [symbols](./dictionary/symbol.md) and establishes the foundation for semantic content.

### [Referent](./dictionary/referent.md)
A basic entity that can participate in the [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md) as [subject](./dictionary/subject.md), [object](./dictionary/object.md), or relationship type. Referents correspond to [constants](./dictionary/constant.md) and maintain [identity](./dictionary/identity.md) through their [relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md).

### [Relation](./dictionary/relation.md)
The third fundamental operation of a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md) that establishes connections between [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) through [relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md). Follows [identification](./dictionary/identification.md) and [qualification](./dictionary/qualification.md).

### [Relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md)
A connection between [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) through the [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md) R(x,y,t), taking various forms including direct relationships, [properties](./dictionary/property.md), [inheritance](./dictionary/inheritance.md), and [reference](./dictionary/reference.md). Creates semantic networks within [catalogues](./dictionary/catalogue.md).

### [Self](./dictionary/self.md)
The unique possession of the [subject](./dictionary/subject.md) of [conscious experience](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md), providing the first-person center of a [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md). Enables [self-evidence](./dictionary/self-evident.md) and distinguishes one consciousness from another.

### [Self-Evident](./dictionary/self-evident.md)
That which is apparent without justification from a given [perspective](./dictionary/perspective.md). [Conscious experiences](./dictionary/conscious-experience.md) are self-evident to the [self](./dictionary/self.md) experiencing them.

### [Semantic Reference Frame](./dictionary/semantic-reference-frame.md)
The foundational framework within which [references](./dictionary/reference.md) and [relationships](./dictionary/relationship.md) can be interpreted and understood. Provides the context for meaning construction in [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md).

### [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md)
A formal logical system built around the [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md) R(x,y,t) that bridges [epistemology](./dictionary/epistemology.md) and [ontology](./dictionary/ontology.md) through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md). SRT provides a universal framework for representing [referential relationships](./dictionary/reference.md) using [catalogues](./dictionary/catalogue.md) of interconnected [referents](./dictionary/referent.md).

### [Semantic Theory](./dictionary/semantic-theory.md)
A specific implementation of [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md) with concrete [constants](./dictionary/constant.md) and [definitions](./dictionary/definition.md). Derived from the general SRT framework through [transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md) operations.

### [Subject](./dictionary/subject.md)
The source of a [relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md) in the [ternary relation](./dictionary/ternary.md) `x =t> y`, where x is the subject. Can initiate [reference](./dictionary/reference.md) to [objects](./dictionary/object.md) and possess [properties](./dictionary/property.md).

### [Symbol](./dictionary/symbol.md)
A [referent](./dictionary/referent.md) whose most specific [relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md) is representing another [referent](./dictionary/referent.md). Distinguished from [literature](./dictionary/literature.md) as the representing rather than represented elements in [symbolism](./dictionary/symbolism.md).

### [Symbolism](./dictionary/symbolism.md)
The collection of [referents](./dictionary/referent.md) that function as [symbols](./dictionary/symbol.md) within a [catalogue](./dictionary/catalogue.md), complementing [literature](./dictionary/literature.md) to form complete representational systems.

### [Ternary](./dictionary/ternary.md)
The fundamental primitive of [Semantic Reference Theory](./dictionary/semantic-reference-theory.md), expressed as R(x,y,t) or `x =t> y`, where x is the [subject](./dictionary/subject.md), y is the [object](./dictionary/object.md), and t is the [relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md) type. When x equals y, t represents a [property](./dictionary/property.md) rather than a relationship.

### [Transduction](./dictionary/transduction.md)
The bridge operation between [epistemology](./dictionary/epistemology.md) and [ontology](./dictionary/ontology.md) that transforms one theory into another while preserving structure. Manifests as [metalogical transduction](./dictionary/metalogical-transduction.md) in formal systems and [metaphysical transduction](./dictionary/metaphysical-transduction.md) in consciousness.

### [Transitivity](./dictionary/transitivity.md)
The property that enables [relationship](./dictionary/relationship.md) chains to compose, allowing [inheritance](./dictionary/inheritance.md) to propagate through multiple connections. Essential for creating hierarchical structures in [catalogues](./dictionary/catalogue.md).
