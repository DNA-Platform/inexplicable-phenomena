- title: [Dictionary](.dictionary.md)
- subject: [Meaning](../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md)

## Definition

1. [Colloquial] A [**dictionary**](dictionary.md) is a canonical source of [canonical](canonical.md) [definitions](definition.md).

2. [Semantic] A [**dictionary**](dictionary.md) is a catalogue of definitions.

3. [Formal] {TBD}

## Explanation

It is [self-evident](self-evident.md) that a [**dictionary**](dictionary.md) is a catalogue of definitions:

## Under Development

The following entries are currently being developed:

### Epistemological Concepts
- Semantic Assertion - How systems express their semantics
- Completeness - Epistemic motive for extending systems
- Consistency - Maintaining coherence across extension

### Consciousness Components
- Self-Evident - What requires no justification

### Structural Concepts
- Self-Reference - How systems represent themselves

- thoughts
  - How does the structure of a dictionary relate to the structure of a catalogue in SRT?
  - What is the significance of self-reference in a dictionary that contains itself as an entry?
  - Can a dictionary ever be complete, or does GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem suggest fundamental limitations?
  - How does the directed graph structure of a dictionary relate to the concept of narrative in SRT?
  - Is the dictionary itself a form of perspective, and if so, whose perspective is it?
  - How do the organizing principles of a dictionary reflect the operations of identification, qualification, and relation?
