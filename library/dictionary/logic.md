## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Logic** is the systematic study of valid inference and reasoning.

2. [Semantic]: **Logic** provides frameworks for analyzing arguments and determining their validity based on their structure rather than their content.

3. [Formal]: {TBD}

## Explanation

Logic provides frameworks for analyzing arguments and determining their validity based on their structure rather than their content. It establishes rules for sound reasoning and inference.

[Semantic Reference Theory](semantic-reference-theory.md) builds upon [formal logic](formal-logic.md) traditions, particularly first-order logic, while introducing a more accessible programmatic grammar and focusing on referential relationships.

SRT expands traditional logical frameworks by emphasizing the role of reference, perspective, and transduction in creating meaningful semantic structures. This allows it to address not only validity of arguments but also the construction of meaning through reference relations.

## Examples

Traditional logical syllogism:
```
All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
```

SRT representation might express this as:
```
!X: human(X) =|> mortal(X)
human(socrates)
=|> mortal(socrates)
```
