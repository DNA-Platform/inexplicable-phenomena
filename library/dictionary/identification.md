## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Identification** is the process of recognizing or establishing the identity of something.

2. [Semantic]: **Identification** is the process by which a [perspective](perspective.md) assigns identity to a referent, enabling it to possess its own identity intrinsically. It is the first fundamental operation of a perspective.

3. [Formal]: `(i) =(o)> (o) |=identify> (o) =(o)> o`

## Explanation

The formal expression represents how identification works:
- `(i)` represents the qualifier of the perspective
- `(o)` represents the symbol for an object
- `o` represents the object itself
- The transduction operator `|=identify>` shows the transformation

Identification occurs when the qualifier of a perspective `(i)` attributes identity to an object through its symbol `(o)`, which then enables the object to possess its own identity intrinsically - expressed as `(o) =(o)> o`.

This self-reference formula `(o) =(o)> o` is crucial - it means the canonical symbol of the object acts as a symbol for the object itself. This establishes the object's intrinsic identity within the perspective.

Identification must occur before [qualification](qualification.md) or [relation](relation.md) can take place - an object must first have identity before it can have qualities or stand in relation to other objects.

## Examples

Basic identification:
```
(i) =(rose)> (rose) |=identify> (rose) =(rose)> rose
```
This expresses how a perspective identifies a particular rose, enabling it to have its own identity.

  - What triggers the initial identification process within a perspective?
  - How does identification relate to recognition of sameness across transformations?
  - Can an object have multiple identities within the same perspective?
