## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Symbolism** refers to the use of symbols to represent ideas or qualities, particularly in art, literature, and communication.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, **symbolism** refers to the collection of referents that function as symbols within a [catalogue](catalogue.md), representing the system of referential relationships that are not part of the [literature](literature.md).

3. [Formal]: `x =sym> y =|> x =x> y & x != y & x == (x,y)`

## Explanation

In Semantic Reference Theory, symbolism is central to understanding how reference operates. A symbol is a specific type of referent that serves to represent something else - it is the purest form of a reference relationship.

The formal definition states that a referent x is a symbol for y when:
1. x has a direct relationship with y (x =x> y)
2. x is distinct from y (x != y)
3. x is identical to the specific relationship (x,y)

This distinguishes symbolism from literature in a catalogue. While literature consists of referents that are the objects of relationships (the things being symbolized), symbolism comprises the referents that function as symbols (the things doing the symbolizing).

The relationship `(x,y)` itself acts as a symbol, representing the connection between subject and object. This creates a system where reference is not just a relation between entities but is embodied in entities that function specifically as symbols.

## Examples

Basic symbolic relationship:
```
word =sym> concept
```

The relationship representation as a symbol:
```
(x,y) =sym> y
```

Symbol inheritance:
```
x =sym> y =|> x -> sym
```

### Thoughts
  - What is the precise distinction between a symbol and other forms of representation?
  - How does symbolism in SRT relate to theories of semiotics?
  - Can a referent function as both a symbol and part of literature?
  - What is the relationship between symbolism and consciousness?
  - How does the formalization of symbolism capture intuitive notions of meaning?
