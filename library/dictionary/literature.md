## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Literature** refers to written works, especially those considered of superior or lasting artistic merit.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, **literature** refers to the semantic reference frame that corresponds to the `literal` property of a [catalogue](catalogue.md).

3. [Formal]: {TBD}

## Explanation

In Semantic Reference Theory, the literature of a catalogue is the semantic reference frame that corresponds to the `literal` property. This provides a framework for representing and interpreting the contents of the catalogue in a literal, direct manner.

The literature of a catalogue establishes the primary semantic context in which referents are understood and related to each other. It defines the basic interpretive framework for understanding the meaning and relationships within the catalogue.
