## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Self-evident** refers to something that is so obvious or true that it doesn't require proof or explanation to be believed or understood.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, a proposition is **self-evident** when it is apparent without justification from a given [perspective](perspective.md), serving as an axiom within that perspective's framework.

3. [Formal]: `{TBD}`

## Explanation

Self-evidence is a fundamental concept in both epistemology and SRT. Something is self-evident when it requires no external justification or proof within a given perspective. In the context of consciousness, self-evidence serves as a bridge between what can be formally proven and what is directly experienced.

The formal expression represents how self-evidence works:
- `(i)` represents the qualifier of a perspective
- `(p)` represents a proposition or referent
- The expression indicates that when a perspective's qualifier intrinsically possesses a proposition, that proposition is self-evident within that perspective

Self-evidence is distinct from proof in formal systems. While proof derives truths from axioms through logical operations, self-evidence identifies truths that are accepted as axiomatic within a particular perspective. These self-evident truths often serve as the foundation upon which other knowledge is built.

In the history of thought, different thinkers have appealed to self-evidence in different contexts:
- Aristotle viewed logical principles as "known by themselves" through intuition
- Kant described certain mathematical and geometric truths as self-evident
- Jefferson declared human equality to be self-evident in the Declaration of Independence

What unites these diverse applications is that self-evidence always implies a perspective from which the truth is directly apprehended without need for further justification.

## Examples

Descartes' Cogito:
```
(i) =(cogito_ergo_sum)> (i)
```
The statement "I think, therefore I am" is self-evident from the first-person perspective because the very act of doubting one's existence proves that existence.

Mathematical axioms:
```
(mathematics) =(x=x)> (x=x)
```
Within the perspective of mathematics, the reflexive property of equality is self-evident.

Perceptual qualities:
```
(i) =(red)> (rose) |=perceive> (rose.red =self_evident> rose.red)
```
From a perspective experiencing a red rose, the redness of the rose is self-evident to that perspective.
