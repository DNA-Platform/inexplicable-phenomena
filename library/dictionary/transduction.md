## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Transduction** refers to the conversion of one form of energy or signal into another form.

2. [Semantic]: **Transduction** is an operation that transforms one theory into another while preserving structure. In SRT, it represents the bridge between epistemology and ontology, resolving inconsistencies between them.

3. [Formal]: Represented by the operator `|=>`

## Explanation

The transduction operator `|=>` denotes a system-changing operation. When a system encounters an existential statement that cannot be satisfied within its current structure, transduction extends the system:

`E[s]: x =s> y & Each[t]: x !=t> y |=t> x =t> y`

This example shows how a new relationship is transduced when needed, but transduction can also introduce new referents into a [catalogue](catalogue.md).

Transduction operates as a formalized version of how semantic systems grow and evolve. It is not merely a syntactic operation but carries semantic significance - the system changes itself by updating its own representation based on its semantic commitments.

Two key forms of transduction are:
- [Metalogical transduction](metalogical-transduction.md): The abstract operation on formal systems
- [Metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md): The physical implementation of the operation that corresponds to consciousness

## Examples

Adding a new constant:
```
E[x]: x.red |=> rose.red
```
The system transduces "rose" as a referent that satisfies the property of being red.

Adding a new relationship:
```
E[r]: Doug =r> book & r.ownership |=> Doug =owns> book
```
The system transduces the "owns" relationship between Doug and book.

Extending a system with a new axiom:
```
S & G |=> S'
```
Where G is a statement unprovable in system S, and S' is the extended system that includes G as an axiom.
