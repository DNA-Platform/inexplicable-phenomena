## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: A **semantic theory** is an account of how meaning is constructed and interpreted in language.

2. [Semantic]: In the context of [Semantic Reference Theory](semantic-reference-theory.md), a **semantic theory** is any theory derived from SRT through the process of [transduction](transduction.md). It represents a valid ontology with specific constants, along with definitions expressed as axioms consistent with the epistemology of SRT.

3. [Philosophical]: A **semantic theory** provides an account of the relationship between language and reality, explaining how symbols acquire meaning and reference.

## Explanation

A semantic theory is generated by extending a candidate for SRT, adding constants, and letting a computational process of proof and transduction unfold. When this process halts with a valid ontology, the semantics specified by SRT are valid for that [catalogue](catalogue.md).

Unlike SRT itself, which functions as a general epistemological framework with no domain-specific constants, a semantic theory includes specific referents and their relationships. It represents the realization of SRT's abstract principles in a concrete domain.

The process of creating a semantic theory through transduction mirrors how humans develop domain-specific knowledge. Starting with general principles of reference and meaning, we construct specific ontologies for different domains (physics, mathematics, psychology, etc.), each with its own referents and relationship types.

## Examples

A semantic theory of color:
```
ColorTheory |=has> (red =as> (wavelength.700nm))
ColorTheory |=has> (blue =as> (wavelength.470nm))
ColorTheory |=has> (yellow =as> (wavelength.580nm))
```

A semantic theory of relationships:
```
FamilyTheory |=has> (parent =as> (relationship))
FamilyTheory |=has> (sibling =as> (relationship))
FamilyTheory |=defines> (x =parent> y & z =parent> y =|> x =sibling> z)
```
