## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: An **object** is an entity toward which action, thought, or emotion is directed, often functioning as the grammatical object in a sentence.

2. [Semantic]: An **object** is a [referent](referent.md) that is the target of a [relationship](relationship.md). In the [ternary relation](ternary.md) R(x,y,t), y is the object.

3. [Formal]: `E[x,y]: x => y =|> E[O]: y.O`

## Explanation

The formal expression states that for any referents x and y where x is related to y (through some relationship type), there exists a property O such that y has this property. This property O represents the quality of "being an object."

Unlike [subjects](subject.md), which must be distinct from their objects, a referent can be classified as an object even when it relates to itself (as in a property relationship). This creates an asymmetry between subjecthood and objecthood in SRT.

Objects form a foundation in SRT as they can exist without being subjects (by being the targets of relationships), whereas subjects require relationships with distinct objects to qualify as subjects.

## Examples

Simple subject-object relationship:
```
Doug =sees> rose
```
Here, "rose" is the object that Doug sees.

Self-reference as object:
```
rose =red> rose
```
"Rose" is both subject and object in this property relationship.

  - What is the relationship between being an object in SRT and objectivity in philosophy?
  - How does the formal property O (objecthood) differ from the property S (subjecthood)?
  - What is the significance of the asymmetry between subject and object in SRT?
  - Can a referent be an object without being part of any catalogue?
