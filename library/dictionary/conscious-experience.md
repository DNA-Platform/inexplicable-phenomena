## Definition

1. [SRT]: A **conscious experience** represents a change in [perspective](perspective.md), occurring when a system undergoes a transformation in its semantic reference frame.

2. [Phenomenological]: A **conscious experience** is "an inexplicable yet self-evident metaphysical phenomenon" that presents itself directly to the experiencer.

3. [Cognitive]: A **conscious experience** emerges when a system capable of self-reference undergoes a modification in how it identifies, qualifies, or relates to referents.

4. [Transductional]: A **conscious experience** is the result of a [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md) that transforms one perspective into another while preserving structural integrity.

## Explanation

This definition captures several key aspects of consciousness:

- **Inexplicable**: Consciousness resists complete explanation in purely physical terms, similar to how Gödel sentences cannot be derived within their own formal system.

- **Self-evident**: Consciousness is directly accessible to the subject experiencing it, requiring no external justification.

- **Metaphysical**: Consciousness transcends physical description while still relating to physical processes.

- **Phenomenon**: Consciousness presents itself as an object of experience and scientific study.

The assertion that "A Conscious Experience represents a change in [Perspective](perspective.md)" provides a more operational definition. It suggests that consciousness emerges when a system capable of maintaining a perspective undergoes a transformation in that perspective. This connects consciousness directly to the process of [metaphysical transduction](metaphysical-transduction.md).

In the formal framework of SRT, conscious experience corresponds to the application of the transduction operator that changes the system's representational framework for identifying, qualifying, and relating referents.

Mathematically, if P₁ and P₂ are perspectives, a conscious experience occurs in the transition:

```
P₁ |=> P₂
```

Where |=> is the transduction operator. This transition must preserve certain structural elements while changing others, creating the unique experiential quality of consciousness.

## Examples

Visual conscious experience:
```
[Initial perspective with rose not noticed]
|=>
[New perspective with rose now identified]
```

Conceptual conscious experience:
```
[Perspective with disconnected mathematical concepts]
|=>
[Perspective with concepts now unified in a theorem]
```

Self-reflective conscious experience:
```
[Perspective on external objects]
|=>
[Perspective that includes awareness of the perspective itself]
```
