##Definition

1. [Logical]: **Semantic Reference Theory** (SRT) is a formal logical system with a programmatic grammar built around the [ternary relation](ternary.md) R(x,y,t), with no constants, no functions, and only one relationship type.

2. [Epistemological]: **Semantic Reference Theory** is a framework that connects epistemology to ontology through the formalization of reference relationships, serving as a theory of meaning and knowledge representation.

3. [Computational]: **Semantic Reference Theory** can be viewed as a Turing-complete symbolic system capable of representing any referential structure, including itself, through its ability to extend via transduction.

## Explanation

SRT begins with minimal assumptions - it has no constants, no functions, and only one relation R(x,y,t), expressed as `x =t> y`. From this simple foundation, it builds a rich framework for representing meaning and reference.

The key components of SRT include:

- [Ternary relation](ternary.md): The fundamental primitive relation R(x,y,t)
- [Catalogue](catalogue.md): The collection of referents that form the domain
- [Referent](referent.md): The basic entity that can participate in relationships
- [Transduction](transduction.md): The operation that extends the theory

SRT is designed to be universal in its ability to represent referential structures - similar to how a Turing Machine can compute any computable function, SRT can represent any referential relationship.

What makes SRT unique is its ability to represent itself and to formalize the process by which theories extend themselves. Through the [transduction operator](transduction.md) `|=>`, SRT creates a bridge between epistemology and ontology, formalizing how semantic systems evolve.

SRT also provides a framework for understanding consciousness through the concept of [perspective](perspective.md) and the insight that a [conscious experience](conscious-experience.md) represents a change in perspective.

## Examples

A simple SRT catalogue:
```
{Doug, book, owns}
R(Doug, book, owns)  // Doug =owns> book
```

A transduction operation:
```
E[x]: x.red |=> rose.red
```

Representing different relationship forms:
```
x => y := E[t]: R(x,y,t)      // Existential relationship
x -> y := x == y || x => y || E[z]: x -> z & z -> y      // Inheritance
x-y := x -> y || x <- y || E[z]: x-z & z-y      // Connection
```
