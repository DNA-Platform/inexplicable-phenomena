## Definition

1. [Linguistic]: **Inexplicable** refers to that which cannot be explained, understood, or accounted for.

2. [Semantic]: In SRT, a phenomenon is **inexplicable** when it cannot be formally derived or entailed by the axioms of a system from which it emerges, despite being recognized as real within that system.

3. [Consciousness]: A phenomenon is **inexplicable** when it resists complete explanation in purely physical terms, similar to how Gödel sentences cannot be derived within their own formal system.

## Explanation

The concept of inexplicability is central to understanding the Hard Problem of consciousness. Chalmers argues that "the emergence of experience goes beyond what can be derived from physical theory" and "the facts about experience cannot be an automatic consequence of any physical account." These statements establish that consciousness isn't merely difficult to explain within our current scientific framework but fundamentally resistant to such explanation.

This resistance to explanation has a precise formal analog in mathematical logic through Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. Just as there exist true statements in mathematical systems that cannot be proven within those systems, there exist aspects of conscious experience that cannot be derived from physical theories alone.

In the formal framework of SRT, inexplicability occurs when:
1. A phenomenon is recognized as real within a perspective
2. The axioms and derivation rules of that perspective cannot produce a formal explanation of the phenomenon
3. The phenomenon nonetheless maintains its presence and influence within the perspective

The relationship between inexplicability and undecidability reveals a deeper connection between consciousness and formal systems. Inexplicability doesn't mean random or arbitrary—it means governed by principles that transcend the formal system being used to analyze it.

## Examples

Gödel sentences in formal systems:
```
"This statement is not provable in system S" is true but not provable in system S
```

The Hard Problem of consciousness:
```
Physical processes =/=> Explanation of why there is "something it is like" to be conscious
```

Perception's relationship to physical stimuli:
```
[Physical description of neural activity] =/=> [Explanation of qualitative experience]
```

Qualia:
```
[Complete physical description of color processing] =/=> [Explanation of why red appears as it does]
```
