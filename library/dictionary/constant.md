## Definition

1. [SRT]: A **constant** in Semantic Reference Theory represents a specific value that can be assigned to a [referent](referent.md), introduced through the process of [transduction](transduction.md).

2. [Formal Logic]: A **constant** is a symbol that stands for a specific, fixed object in the domain of discourse, as contrasted with variables which can range over multiple objects.

3. [Mathematical]: A **constant** is a value that remains unchanged throughout a mathematical process or context.

4. [Computational]: A **constant** is an identifier whose associated value cannot be altered during program execution, serving as a fixed reference point.

## Explanation

In Semantic Reference Theory, constants play a crucial role in bridging epistemology and ontology. A pure SRT framework initially has no built-in constants - they are introduced through the process of [transduction](transduction.md) when converting from epistemological statements (with quantified variables) to ontological ones with specific referents in a [catalogue](catalogue.md).

For example, when an existential statement like "there exists an x such that x has property P" is transduced, it results in a constant 'a' being added to the catalogue with the specified property:

```
∃x: x.P |=> a.P
```

In this process, the variable x is replaced by the constant a, which represents a specific referent in the catalogue.

Constants in SRT correspond to what would typically be called individuals or objects in traditional logic. They provide the concrete instantiations that populate the catalogue, giving specific form to the abstract structure defined by the theory's axioms.

The relationship between constants and referents is direct: constants are the formal symbols in the language of SRT that denote specific referents in the domain. Every constant refers to exactly one referent, though multiple constants could potentially refer to the same referent.

## Examples

Transduction introducing constants:
```
∃x,y: x =loves> y |=> Alice =loves> Bob
```

Here, the variables x and y are replaced by the constants Alice and Bob.

Multiple constants referring to same referent:
```
Morning_Star.planet
Evening_Star.planet
Morning_Star == Evening_Star  // Both constants refer to Venus
```
