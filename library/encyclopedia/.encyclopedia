This is a comprehensive collection of in-depth articles exploring key concepts in Semantic Reference Theory, consciousness, and philosophy of mind.

## Entries

- [Cogito, Ergo Sum](cogito-ergo-sum.md) - An exploration of Descartes' famous philosophical proposition "I think, therefore I am" through the lens of Semantic Reference Theory.

- [Perspective](perspective.md) - A formal framework for identification, qualification, and relation that emerges from the referential structure of consciousness, explaining how conscious experience manifests through the qualifier's operations of identification, qualification, and relation.

- [Qualia](qualia.md) - A critical examination of the concept of qualia, arguing against the reification of perceptual qualities as separate entities, instead positioning qualities as perceptual properties that don't require separate ontological status.

- [Reference](reference.md) - An exploration of how symbols relate to their referents in Semantic Reference Theory, including direct reference, specific relationships, representation, and the emergence of canonical symbols in linguistic systems.

- [Relationship](relationship.md) - A formal taxonomy of relationships in Semantic Reference Theory, categorizing the various ways entities connect within semantic networks and the inheritance structures that enable the propagation of meaning.

- [Semantic Reference Frame](semantic-reference-frame.md) - The structural foundation that establishes how entities are identified, qualified, and related within a system of meaning, serving as the basis for perspective and conscious experience.

- [Semantic Reference Theory](semantic-reference-theory.md) - A comprehensive overview of the formal system that uses programmatic grammar to replace traditional logical notation, centering on the ternary relation R(x,y,t) to express direct relationships and providing a framework for understanding reference, meaning, and consciousness.
