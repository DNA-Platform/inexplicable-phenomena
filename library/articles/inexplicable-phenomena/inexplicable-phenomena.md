#### Abstract

Since Descartes first proclaimed "cogito, ergo sum" back in 1637, "I think, therefore I am" has become the Declaration of Independence for consciousness. Chalmers informed us of the fact that science has a constitutionally *Hard Problem* on their hands. If he's right, conscious experience may forever elude our most powerful explanatory framework for physical phenomena. In other news, a group referring to themselves as the *IIT-Concerned* recently proclaimed in Nature Neuroscience that any theory of consciousness that can't stand up to the scrutiny of science shall be deemed "unscientific." And the emergence of Semantic AI has transformed this philosophical oddity into a practical concern with real ethical implications. We simply cannot know whether AI systems are conscious without first knowing the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness. How can we provide a formal definition of conscious experience that preserves the essence of its metaphysical character in a framework that is physically falsifiable? 

### Refactoring

This paper requires significant refactoring to achieve both greater clarity and stronger theoretical alignment with its Gödelian inspiration. Our refactoring strategy will begin with the title itself, changing "On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems" to "On Formally Inexplicable Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems." The shift from "Formal" to "Formally" as an adverbial form will create a direct parallel with Gödel's "Formally Undecidable," while removing "Self-Evident" will trade precision for readability. These changes reflect our broader goal of making complex ideas accessible without sacrificing their essential meaning.

In an effort to promote readability, our most significant change will be to divide the content into two focused papers rather than one single manuscript. The first paper will develop the Gödelian parallel with proper depth and precision, examining how consciousness presents an explanatory challenge for science that is similar to those Gödel identified in mathematics. The second paper will elaborate the formal machinery of Semantic Reference Theory with an emphasis on developing a new first-order theory. Both papers will focus on the notion of a perspective and both papers will make use of transduction as the mechanism through which a conscious experience comes into being. 

This separation allows us to define consciousness in two separate but related formal mathematical structures without either overshadowing the other. One will be more established, yet dense. The other, more elegant, bespoke and novel. By dedicating separate papers to these complementary dimensions, we create a more coherent and rigorous presentation of one unified framework by presenting two equivalent formulations.

### Perspective

Formalizing perspective is fundamental to understanding consciousness, yet it demands a mathematical framework distinct from traditional logical systems. By allocating an entire paper to this task, we can develop Semantic Reference Theory with the depth and rigor it deserves. This separation allows us to remain on familiar mathematical terrain in the first paper—developing the Gödelian parallel through established concepts in formal systems theory—while giving us freedom to elaborate an entirely new algebraic structure in the second.

The concept of perspective sits at the intersection of formal systems and conscious experience. It provides the framework within which both objective facts and subjective experiences find their place. Yet perspective itself requires formalization—not just as a philosophical notion but as a precise mathematical structure with well-defined properties and operations. This formalization involves developing reference frames, qualification operators, and transduction mechanisms that together capture how conscious beings construct and maintain their view of reality.

By dedicating a separate paper to developing the formal machinery of perspective, we can establish its algebraic properties without being constrained by the need to simultaneously defend its philosophical foundations. We can systematically define reference relations, explore their composition rules, examine their invariants, and demonstrate how they generate the structures we experience as consciousness. This mathematical clarity will complement the Gödelian analysis in the first paper, creating a comprehensive framework that addresses consciousness from complementary formal perspectives.
