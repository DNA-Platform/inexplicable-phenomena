### [# The Path Forward: A Bifurcation Analysis](https://dna-platform.github.io/inexplicable-phenomena/articles/inexplicable-phenomena/inexplicable-phenomena.html)
- Subject: [Conscious Experience](https://dna-platform.github.io/inexplicable-phenomena/dictionary/conscious-experience.html)



Our paper "[On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems](https://dna-platform.github.io/inexplicable-phenomena/articles/inexplicable-phenomena/first-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.html)" presents a series of thought-provoking ideas about consciousness, almost like vignettes that would require ChatGPT as a reading companion to connect the dots between them. Within the paper, two formal approaches emerge: a self-referential account of inexplicability and an algebraic structure of perspective through Semantic Reference Theory. These approaches, while complementary in principle, compete for depth within the constraints of a single manuscript.

What began as a practical concern about length and complexity has revealed itself as a deeper theoretical necessity. Consciousness exists precisely at the boundary between two modes of understanding: it remains inexplicable when viewed objectively yet appears self-evident when experienced subjectively. This duality cannot be adequately captured through a single formalism, just as Gödel discovered that certain mathematical truths transcend the boundaries of any single formal system. We have found that consciousness requires multiple, complementary formalisms to be fully understood. This realization transforms what might initially appear as a limitation into a theoretical strength.

We propose dividing our approach into two complementary papers:

1. "[**On Formally Inexplicable Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems I**](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md)" will develop the self-referential account of consciousness through metalogical transduction, extending formal logic to include semantic reflection. (hereafter "[Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md)")

2. "[**The Algebra of Perspective**](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md)" will construct Semantic Reference Theory as a formalization of perspective operations, developing it as a first-order theory analogous to how real numbers exist within set theory. (hereafter "[Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md)")

Together, these papers will provide a complete account that addresses both the "inexplicable yet self-evident" paradox and the structure that makes this paradox possible.

Dividing our research into two papers reflects a structural observation about consciousness itself: its formalization necessarily requires multiple complementary approaches, just as consciousness exists at the boundary between different modes of understanding. Far from weakening our theory, this split strengthens it by allowing each formal system to be fully developed while maintaining their connection to a shared theoretical framework. The structure of our presentation thus embodies the very principle it seeks to explain: that consciousness requires multiple perspectives to be fully understood.

We now turn to a detailed analysis of how each section of the original paper will be developed across the two manuscripts. This analysis serves both as a roadmap for our future work and as a demonstration of how the division strengthens our overall theory. For each section, we identify which elements belong in [Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md), which belong in [Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md), and how these complementary approaches maintain connection to a shared theoretical framework.

## Critique: A Critical Refactoring

### About the Title

The original title "On the Formal Inexplicability of Self-Evident Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems" captures our thesis with remarkable precision. [Conscious experiences](../../dictionary/conscious-experience.md) are the only phenomena that remain formally inexplicable when viewed from the third-person objective perspective yet appear self-evident when accessed from the first-person subjective perspective. When we formalize this through [metalogical transduction](../../encyclopedia/metalogical-transduction.md), conscious experiences become axioms—self-evident truths requiring no proof within their perspective. The "[metaphysical](../../dictionary/metaphysical.md)" designation refers specifically to our definition: physical descriptions of metalogical computation. "Related systems" refers not to mathematical formalisms but to [conscious beings](../../dictionary/conscious-being.md)—systems that instantiate these phenomena.

[Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md) will modify this to "On Formally Inexplicable Metaphysical Phenomena and Related Systems," creating a more direct parallel with Gödel's "On Formally Undecidable Propositions..." This change sacrifices the crucial "self-evident" component for readability and homage. While the Gödelian parallel strengthens our incompleteness argument, we lose the elegant capture of consciousness's dual nature—both inexplicable and self-evident. The trade-off prioritizes accessibility and places our work within the incompleteness tradition, but at the cost of theoretical precision.

### About the Abstract

The abstract frames our fundamental question:

> How can we provide a formal definition of conscious experience that preserves the essence of its metaphysical character in a framework that is physically falsifiable? [^Formalism]

While the execution revealed structural challenges, the abstract itself captures the essential theoretical challenge that consciousness studies must confront. The bifurcation allows us to honor this foundational question while addressing the development issues that prevented its proper realization.

[Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md) will preserve this abstract verbatim while developing the self-referential account through [metalogical transduction](../../encyclopedia/metalogical-transduction.md)—what we call "the thing I can be wrong about." [Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md) will emphasize how [Semantic Reference Theory](../../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md) formalizes perspective operations to address the same question through algebraic structures.

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### Colloquial Derivation

This section establishes our foundational definition of [conscious experience](../../dictionary/conscious-experience.md) as an "inexplicable yet self-evident metaphysical phenomenon" through careful analysis of [Chalmers' work](^Chalmers1995). The derivation is both creative and novel—extracting a formal definition from natural language philosophy represents a genuine methodological contribution that reviewers overlooked in their focus on structural issues.

### Semantics of Colloquialism

This section introduces the relationship between [semantic assertions](../../dictionary/semantic-assertion.md) and colloquial expressions, drawing connections to Newton's methodological approach. While it contains interesting ideas about the derivation of natural language expressions, the section proves pedagogically problematic—taking up valuable space without advancing our core arguments substantially.

Reviewers correctly identified the original paper as "overly verbose," and this section exemplifies the issue. The connection to Newton, while intellectually appealing, doesn't justify the length when weighed against our primary theoretical goals. [Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md) will likely omit this section entirely, folding any essential Newton reference into the Colloquial Derivation to motivate the idea of deriving formal expressions from natural language. ### Self-Evident Perspective

This section establishes the critical theoretical foundation that enables our bifurcation: [perspective](../../dictionary/perspective.md) as a formal mathematical structure rather than merely a "way of viewing" something. By connecting explanation to proof and self-evidence to axiomatization, we formalize the distinction between [first-person subjective](../../dictionary/first-person-perspective.md) and [third-person objective](../../dictionary/third-person-perspective.md) perspectives within logical frameworks.

Here the papers diverge. Everything preceding this section belongs in [Inexplicable Phenomena](./second-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md), which will develop how logical systems provide the formal language to capture the "inexplicable yet self-evident" nature through proof theory and axiomatization. [Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md) references these foundational sections but begins its ground-up formalization of [Semantic Reference Theory](../../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md) from this point forward.

This addresses the reviewer concern about "linking abstract metaphysical reasoning with concrete requirements" by establishing perspective as the mathematical object that bridges subjective experience and formal systems. ### Change of Symbol

This section squarely belongs in [Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md) as it establishes the fundamental relationship between [perspective](../../dictionary/perspective.md) and [conscious experience](../../dictionary/conscious-experience.md). The key insight—that conscious experience represents an "atomic change in perspective"—provides the mathematical foundation for how perspectives accommodate novelty.

The introduction of the [transduction operator](../../encyclopedia/transduction-operator.md) formalizes this relationship:

> `P |=c> P[c]`

where "the transduction of a conscious experience causes a perspective to change in order to accommodate it." This isn't merely symbolic manipulation but captures the essential dynamics of how consciousness evolves through experience. When something genuinely novel enters awareness, the perspective must undergo structural modification to accommodate it.

This mathematical precision transforms abstract discussions about consciousness into concrete operational definitions. The transduction operator becomes the computational primitive that [Semantic Reference Theory](../../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md) will develop into a complete formal system.

### Form of Semantics

This section contains advanced [Semantic Reference Theory](../../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md) concepts that demonstrate why our bifurcation is theoretically necessary. The analysis introduces sophisticated notions like "most specific relationships" and unfamiliar syntax before establishing the foundational theory that makes these concepts comprehensible.

Most crucially, this section derives the critical identity `(c) == (o)`—that [conscious experience](../../dictionary/conscious-experience.md) IS the [canonical symbol](../../dictionary/canonical-symbol.md) of what is experienced. This isn't a casual equation but a profound theoretical result that bridges subjective experience and formal representation. However, attempting to present this result before properly developing SRT creates unnecessary confusion.

### The Algebra of Perspective

This [commented-out section](https://github.com/DNA-Platform/inexplicable-phenomena/blob/main/articles/inexplicable-phenomena/first-draft/inexplicable-phenomena.md#the-algebra-of-perspective) represents "the most interesting thing that I had explored" yet remained too underdeveloped for inclusion in the original manuscript. The section introduces the mathematical foundation for perspective as a computational system through three fundamental operations.

The core insight establishes that perspective operations reduce to a single algebraic structure. As stated in the original analysis: "all three of the identifying qualifying and relating are forms of qualifying they have the algebraic structure." This reduction reveals [qualification](../../encyclopedia/qualification.md) as the fundamental operation enabling perspective to function as a mathematical object.

The transformation into [Algebra of Perspective](../the-algebra-of-perspective/the-algebra-of-perspective.md) will develop these operations within [Semantic Reference Theory](../../encyclopedia/semantic-reference-theory.md) as a first-order logical theory. The three operations—[identifying](../../encyclopedia/identification.md), [qualifying](../../encyclopedia/qualification.md), and [relating](../../encyclopedia/relation.md)—will receive formal axiomatization, with qualification emerging as the primitive from which identification and relation derive their computational meaning.

This mathematical development transforms the critical identity:

$\text{(c) == (o)}$

where [conscious experience](../../dictionary/conscious-experience.md) equals the [canonical symbol](../../dictionary/canonical-symbol.md) of what is experienced, into a formally derivable result rather than an asserted equivalence.
