## Note

A note about the semantics of finite proof, w-incompleteness, and how Goldbach's Conjecture is involved. Godel assigns a unique number to each proof that expresses each sentence of the proof as a sequence of formulas on the exponents of sequences of primes. For a proof with Godel Number P, Let us consider what other proofs might be expressed on the set of primes less than P that sum to 2*P, when considered across all possible Godel Numbering schemes for formulas. 

Note that in this context, Golbach's Conjecture (GC), which states that every even natural number greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two primes. One of them will be less than P. If we imagine representing formulas on this sequence of primes, GC assures us that every Godel Number for a proof can correspond to an axiom.
