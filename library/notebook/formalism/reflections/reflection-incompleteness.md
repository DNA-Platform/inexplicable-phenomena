# [Imaginary] Reflection: On Incompleteness

## Note

**Step 1:** [Realization] *Metalogical Realization*

$Prov_I("I", \phi) ⇒ \phi$

*We are reflecting on the provability predicate, which captures the essence of proof. This is equivalent to the soundness principle.*

**Step 2:** [Assertion] *Fundamental Assertion of Metalogic*

$¬(Prov_I("I", \phi) \land Prov_I("I", ¬\phi))$

*Consistency is the essence of logic. To remain consistent in the harshest conditions is the very definition of being logical.*

**Step 3:** [Introspection] *Metalogical Dichotomy*

$(Prov_I("I", \phi) \land Prov_I("I", ¬\phi)) \oplus$

$(Prov_I("I", ¬\phi) \land Prov_I("I", \phi))$

*A consequence of completeness.*

*[Possibility]*

**Step 4:** [Introspection] *Metalogical Trichotomy*

$(Prov_I("I", \phi) \land ¬ Prov_I("I", ¬\phi)) \oplus$

$(¬ Prov_I("I", \phi) \land ¬ Prov_I("I", ¬\phi)) \oplus$

$(¬ Prov_I("I", \phi) \land Prov_I("I", ¬\phi))$

*A consequence of incompleteness.*

*[Possibility]*

**Step 5:** [Consideration] *Metalogical Reflection*

$[2] \oplus [4]$

*We must choose between consistency and the trichotomy.*

**Step 6:** [Realization] *Metalogical Axiom*

$Prov_I("I", "\phi \lor ¬\phi")$

*All axioms must be assertions and the "Law of the Excluded Middle" is important.*

**Step 7: [Semantic Contradiction]** *Comparison*

$[4] \text{ vs } [6]$

*[4] contains the "Excluded Middle"!*

**Step 8:** [Realization] *Logical Consequence*

$[2]$

*Which ends our consideration from step 5.*

- How does this formalism relate to conscious experience?
- What are the implications for artificial systems?
- Can formal systems capture the essence of perspective?
